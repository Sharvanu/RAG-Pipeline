# RAG-Pipeline
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which enhances LLM responses by grounding them in external data. Instead of relying only on the model’s internal knowledge, the RAG system retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and uses them to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
